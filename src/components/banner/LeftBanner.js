        A passionate software engineer and backend developer, I have been immersed in the world of programming since the tender age of seven. This early start gave me a deep understanding of coding, its logic, and a unique ability to master new languages swiftly.
        <br></br><br></br>
        C++ is my forte, a language I have honed my skills in throughout my academic and professional career. I appreciate its efficient and performant nature, and I thrive on the challenges it presents. I have a knack for optimizing code and squeezing out maximum performance, contributing to leaner, faster, and more reliable software applications.
        <br></br><br></br>

        Although I am well-versed in Python, it has been a while since I have actively worked in this language. However, my foundational understanding of it remains solid, and I am confident that I could easily refresh my skills when needed.
        <br></br><br></br>

        Currently, I am expanding my knowledge base by learning TypeScript. I am drawn to its flexibility and the fact that it offers static typing, a feature I appreciate from my extensive work with C++. TypeScript is a powerful tool for building large-scale applications, and I am eager to implement this newfound knowledge in my future projects.
        <br></br><br></br>

        While my primary focus and expertise lie in backend development, I have some exposure to UI. However, I must admit that this is not my strongest suit. My passion and strength lie in working behind the scenes, creating the robust engines that drive applications. I am happiest when working on the server-side, building, and managing the technology that powers the user-facing components.
        <br></br><br></br>

        In conclusion, as a devoted software engineer, my aim is to continue learning, improving, and pushing the boundaries of what is possible in backend development. I am committed to using my skills and experience to create innovative and impactful software solutions.
